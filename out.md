Globus is a service that makes it easy to move\, sync\, and share large amounts of data\.

Globus will manage file transfers\, monitor performance\, retry failures\, recover from faults automatically when possible\, and report the status of your data transfer\.

Globus uses GridFTP for more reliable and high\-performance file transfer\, and will queue file transfers to be performed asynchronously in the background\.

Globus was developed and is maintained at the University of Chicago and is used extensively at supercomputer centers and major research facilities\. _[https://globus\.org](https://globus.org)_

# When To use Globus

To transfer or share data between two Globus managed endpoints \(e\.g\. two multi\-user systems at different universities\, each running a Globus server\)

To transfer data between a managed endpoint \(e\.g\. UH\-HPC\) to a Globus Connect Personal endpoint \(e\.g\. your desktop\)

# Globus Plus

For some kinds of data transfer or sharing\, you need Globus Plus\. The UH Globus subscription includes Globus Plus for all users\, but you need to to request a Globus Plus invite\.

To transfer data between two Globus Connect Personal endpoints \(e\.g\. your desktop system and a laptop\)\.

To share data from a Globus Connect Personal endpoint \(e\.g\. your desktop system\)

To transfer data from/to a shared endpoint that is hosted on a Globus Connect Personal endpoint\.

Note 1: if your collaborator needs Globus Plus to download data\, and is not at UH\, we cannot provide Globus Plus to that person\.

Note 2: By default\, files on a Globus Connect Personal endpoint \(e\.g\. your laptop or desktop\) may not be shareable\. You will need to configure that via the instructions at these links: Linux\, Mac\, Windows\.

__Creating a Globus Account Using UH Credential__

<span style="color:#595959">Visit</span>  <span style="color:#595959"> _[www\.globus\.org](https://www.globus.org/)_ </span>  <span style="color:#595959">and click "Login" at the top of the page\. On the Globus login page\, type in University of Hawaii\. When you find it\, click Continue\.</span>

<img src="img/dt-workshop5.png" width=500px />

# You’ll be redirected to your UH login page. Use your UH credentials to login.

<img src="img/dt-workshop6.png" width=500px />

# Some organizations will ask for your permission to release your account information to Globus. Once you’ve logged in with your UH credentials, Globus will ask if you’d like to link to an existing account. If this is your first time logging in to Globus, click "Continue." If you’ve already used another account with Globus, you can choose "Link to an existing account."

<img src="img/dt-workshop7.png" width=500px />

# You may be prompted to provide additional information such as your organization and whether or not Globus will be used for commercial purposes. Click on non-profit research or educational purposes. Complete the form and click "Continue."

<img src="img/dt-workshop8.png" width=500px />

# Finally, you need to give Globus permission to use your identity to access information and perform actions (like file transfers) on your behalf.

<span style="color:#595959"> __Tip__ </span>

<span style="color:#595959"> __Key Concept:__ </span>  <span style="color:#595959"> _Collection_ </span>

<span style="color:#595959">A collection is a named location containing data you can access with Globus\. Collections can be hosted on many different kinds of systems\, including campus storage\, HPC clusters\, laptops\,</span>  <span style="color:#595959"> _Amazon S3 buckets\, Google Drive_ </span>  <span style="color:#595959"> _\(these are_ </span>  <span style="color:#595959"> _“premium” connectors so seperate subscription is required\)_ </span>  <span style="color:#595959">\, and scientific instruments\.</span>

<span style="color:#595959">When you use Globus\, you don’t need to know a physical location or details about storage\. You only need a collection name\. A collection allows authorized Globus users to browse and transfer files\. Collections can also be used for sharing data with others and for enabling discovery by other Globus users\.</span>  <span style="color:#595959"> _[Globus Connect](https://www.globus.org/globus-connect)_ </span>  <span style="color:#595959">is used to host collections\.</span>

# Access a collection

<span style="color:#595959">Click in the Collection field at the top of the File Manager page and type ”UH\-HPC"\. Globus will list collections with matching names\. Choose UH\-HPC\.</span>

<img src="img/dt-workshop12.png" width=500px />

# Globus will connect to the UH-HPC collection and display the default directory, /~/.  This is your home directory in the Mana Globus endpoint. Click on “Transfer or Sync to”.

<img src="img/dt-workshop13.png" width=500px />

# Request a file transfer

<span style="color:#595959">A new collection panel will open\, with a ”Search" field at the top of the panel\. Click on it\.</span>

<img src="img/dt-workshop14.png" width=500px />

# Click on “Your Collection” tab. Find the Globus Connect Personal endpoint you created earlier and click on it.

<img src="img/dt-workshop15.png" width=500px />

# On the left collection, UH-HPC, select the file you would like to transfer. The Start> button at the top of the panel will activate. Click the Start> button to transfer the selected files to the collection in the right panel.

<img src="img/dt-workshop16.png" width=500px />

# Globus will display a green notification panel—​confirming that the transfer request was submitted—​and add a badge to the “Activity” item in the command menu on the left of the page. Click Activity in the command menu on the left of the page to go to the Activity page.

<img src="img/dt-workshop17.png" width=500px />

# Confirm Transfer CompletionOn the Activity page, click the arrow icon on the right to view details about the transfer. You will also receive an email with the transfer details.

<span style="color:#595959">‘lsf’ is how we list files using Rclone</span>

<span style="color:#595959">> rclone lsf rclone\-gdrive:/</span>

<span style="color:#000000">Lets create a directory to transfer files to/from</span>

<span style="color:#595959">Make a directory called “rclonefiles” using  the “mkdir” command</span>

<span style="color:#595959">> mkdir rclonefiles</span>

<span style="color:#595959">Move into the directory we just created</span>

<span style="color:#595959">> cd rclonefiles</span>

<span style="color:#595959">‘cd’ is the change directory command</span>

<span style="color:#000000">Create a test document for transfer</span>

<span style="color:#595959">In google drive create a folder name it “rclonetest”\.  Within that folder create a new doc and call it “testfile”\.</span>

<span style="color:#595959">Now copy the directory contents from GDrive to Mana\. ‘rclone copy’ has a source and destination required\. GDrive being the source in the example below and the current directory \(represented by the ‘\.’\) the destination</span>

<span style="color:#595959">> rclone copy rclone\-gdrive:/rclonetest \.</span>

<span style="color:#595959">This will copy the folder contents to the current directory \- Note the ‘\.’ at the end this is represents the current directory as the destination folder \- we could also have used ~/rclonefiles or /home/username/rclonefiles as that same folder path\.</span>

<span style="color:#000000">Lets transfer a file from Mana to GDrive</span>

<span style="color:#595959">Create a testfile2\.docx</span>  <span style="color:#595959">on the Mana DTN by copying testfile\.docx</span>

<span style="color:#595959">> cp testfile\.docx testfile2\.docx</span>

<span style="color:#595959">‘cp’ is the copy command in the terminal/shell</span>

<span style="color:#595959">> ls</span>

<span style="color:#595959">testfile2\.docx  testfile\.docx</span>

<span style="color:#595959">‘ls’ is how we list files in the terminal/shell</span>

<span style="color:#595959">Now copy testfile2\.docx to GDrive \( the source is the Mana testfile2\.docx and the destination is gdrive\)</span>

<span style="color:#595959">>rclone copy testfile2\.docx rclone\-gdrive:/rclonetest</span>

<span style="color:#595959">You can check GDrive and the file should appear</span>

<span style="color:#595959">The ‘rclone copy’ command is the way to move files to or from GDrive\.</span>

<span style="color:#595959">The copy command on a folder will overwrite files that have the same name but if a files exists on the destination that isn’t in the folder being copied it will be retained on the destination \(when we get to sync you will see a difference in this behavior\)</span>

<span style="color:#595959">The sync command is useful to keep a folder on GDrive and somewhere else with identical contents \- meaning that if the destination folder has files that do not exist on the source they will be removed \(so be careful\)</span>

<span style="color:#595959">rclone sync  source destination</span>

<span style="color:#595959">Let remove testfile\.docx and sync our rclonefiles folder to our GDrive rclonetest folder</span>

<span style="color:#595959">> rm testfile\.docx</span>

<span style="color:#595959">> rclone sync  ~/rclonefiles rclone\-gdrive:/rclonetest</span>

<span style="color:#595959">We should see in GDrive that now only testfile2\.docx is there because the folders are in sync \- Mana’s rclonefiles folder was the source so the GDrive rclonetest folder is now identical to rclonefiles</span>

<span style="color:#595959">For transfers that make take a long time that you do not wish to observe or that your connection might disconnect you should use ‘nohup’ so they run in the background until complete\. Example of nohup ‘rclone copy’ below:</span>

<span style="color:#595959">> nohup rclone copy source destination > nohup\.out &</span>

<span style="color:#595959">The ‘>’ after the destination will direct any standard output to be written to the nohup\.out file and the ‘&’ on the end tells the shell to disconnect the command issued and run it in the background so you can still use your terminal/shell for other commands or exiting the session \- the command issued with ‘nohup’ will continue to run\.</span>
